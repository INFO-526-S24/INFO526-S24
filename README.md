### Disclosure

This content is derived from the course website for [STA 313 - Advanced Data Visualization at Duke University](https://vizdata.org/), taught by Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel. I changed duke centric examples to Tucson centric, and removed lecture activities. The website has a new logo, color scheme, fonts, and style.

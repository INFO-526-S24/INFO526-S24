# Warm up

## Announcements

-   Course and TA evaluations
    -   If we can get to \>=90% participation for both, each person gets +5 points on their lowest (not dropped) homework score.
    -   Current participation rate: TA evals 8.5% and course evals 5.9%.
-   [Project 1s are posted on the course website](https://vizdata.org/student-work/project-1.html). I will remove the scores from the repos after the semester ends.
-   Also posted are your [thank you cards](https://vizdata.org/student-work/thank-you.html) and [ugly plots](https://vizdata.org/student-work/ugly-plot.html)!

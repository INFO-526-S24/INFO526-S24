# Warm up

## Announcements

-   A note on readings for this week: some of it is review so feel free to skim those parts.
-   RQ 1 is due Friday (Jan 26)

## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: "|1-4|6-7|9-10|12-19"

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(countdown)

# set theme for ggplot2
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 14))

# set width of code output
options(width = 65)

# set figure parameters for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 7,        # 7" width
  fig.asp = 0.618,      # the golden ratio
  fig.retina = 3,       # dpi multiplier for displaying HTML output on retina
  fig.align = "center", # center align figures
  dpi = 300             # higher dpi, sharper image

## Data-to-ink ratio {.smaller}

Tufte strongly recommends maximizing the **data-to-ink ratio** this in the Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Tufte, 1983).

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
> Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data---a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design ... \[It\] consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. ... \[It\] is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space ... \[It\] is nearly always multivariate ... And graphical excellence requires telling the truth about the data. (Tufte, 1983, p. 51).

## Discussion

Can you spot the differences between the code here and the one provided in the previous slide? Are there any differences in the resulting plot? Work in a pair (or group) to answer.
:::

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3, color_background = "white")
```

## Global vs. layer-specific aesthetics

-   Aesthetic mappings can be supplied in the initial `ggplot()` call, in individual layers, or in some combination of both.

-   Within each layer, you can add, override, or remove mappings.

-   If you only have one layer in the plot, the way you specify aesthetics doesn't make any difference. However, the distinction is important when you start adding additional layers.

## Activity: Spot the differences II {.smaller}

::: task
Do you expect the following plots to be the same or different? If different, how? Discuss in a pair (or group) without running the code and sketch the resulting plots based on what you think the code will produce.
:::

::: task
## Plot

```{r}
#| label: spot-differences-2
#| fig-show: "hide"

# Plot A
ggplot(tucsonHousing, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = decade_built_cat))

# Plot B
ggplot(tucsonHousing, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue")

# Plot C
ggplot(tucsonHousing, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(color = "#a493ba")
```
:::

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3, color_background = "white")
```

## Wrap up

::: task
Think back to all the plots you saw in the lecture, without flipping back through the slides. Which plot first comes to mind? Describe it in words.

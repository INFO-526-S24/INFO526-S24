For any exercise where you're writing code, insert a code chunk and make sure to label the chunk. Use a short and informative label. For any exercise where you're creating a plot, make sure to label all axes, legends, etc. and give it an informative title. For any exercise where you're including a description and/or interpretation, use full sentences. Make a commit at least after finishing each exercise, or better yet, more frequently. Push your work regularly to GitHub. Once you're done, inspect your GitHub repo to make sure it has all the components you want to submit in the `hw-01.md` file, including the prose, the code, and all plots.

1.  **Road traffic accidents in Edinburgh.** Next we'll look at traffic accidents in Edinburgh. The data are made available [online](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data/datafile/36f1658e-b709-47e7-9f56-cca7aefeb8fe/preview) by the UK Government. It covers all recorded accidents in Edinburgh in 2018 and some of the variables were modified for the purposes of this assignment. The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it's called `accidents`. You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation with `?accidents` and you can also find this information [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/accidents.html). Recreate the following plot, and interpret in context of the data.

2.  **NYC marathon winners.** The New York City Marathon is an annual marathon (26.2 miles / 42.195 kilometers) that courses through the five boroughs of New York City. Marathon times of runners in the Men and Women divisions of the New York City Marathon between 1970 and 2020 can be found in the `nyc_marathon` dataset in the **openintro** package (which is already installed for you). You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation with `?nyc_marathon` and you can also find this information [here](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/nyc_marathon.html).

    a\. Create a histogram and a box plot of the distribution of marathon times of all runners in the dataset. What features of the distribution are apparent in the histogram and not the box plot? What features are apparent in the box plot but not in the histogram?

    b\. Create a side-by-side box plots of marathon times for men and women. Use different colors for the each of the box plots -- do not use the default colors, but instead manually define them (you can choose any two colors you want). Based on the plots you made, compare the distribution of marathon times for men and women.

    c\. What information in the above plot is redundant? Redo the plot avoiding this redundancy. How does this update change the data-to-ink ratio?

    d\. Visualize the marathon times of men and women over the years. As is usual with time series plot, year should go on the x-axis. Use different colors and shapes to represent the times for men and women. Make sure your colors match those in the previous part. Once you have your plot, describe what is visible in this plot but not in the others.

3.  **US counties.** The following questions use the `county` dataset in the **openintro** package. You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation with `?county` and you can also find this information [here](https://openintrostat.github.io/usdata/reference/county.html).

    a\. What does the following code do? Does it work? Does it make sense? Why/why not?

    ``` r
    ggplot(county) +
      geom_point(aes(x = median_edu, y = median_hh_income)) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(x = smoking_ban, y = pop2017))
    ```

    b\. Which of the following two plots makes it easier to compare poverty levels (poverty) across people from different median education levels (median_edu)? What does this say about when to place a faceting variable across rows or columns?

    ``` r
    ggplot(county %>% filter(!is.na(median_edu))) + 
      geom_point(aes(x = homeownership, y = poverty)) + 
      facet_grid(median_edu ~ .)
    ```

    ![](images/county-facets-1.png)<!-- -->

    ``` r
    ggplot(county %>% filter(!is.na(median_edu))) + 
      geom_point(aes(x = homeownership, y = poverty)) + 
      facet_grid(. ~ median_edu)
    ```

    c\. Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs. Note that wherever a categorical variable is used in the plot, it's `metro`.

4.  **Rental apartments in SF.** The data for this exercise comes from TidyTuesday and it's on rental prices in San Francisco. You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-07-05). The dataset you'll be using is called `rent`. Create a visualization that will help you compare the distribution of rental prices (`price`) per bedroom (`beds`) across neighborhoods (`nhood`) in the city of San Francisco (`city == "san francisco"`), over time. Limit your analysis to rentals where the full unit is available, i.e. (`room_in_apt  == 0`). You have the flexibility to choose which years and which neighborhoods. Note that you should have a maximum of 8 neighborhoods on your visualization, but one or more of them can be a combination of many (e.g., an "other" category). Your visualization should also display some measure of the variability in your data. You get to decide what type of visualization to create and there is more than one correct answer! In your answer, include a brief description of why you made the choices you made as well as an interpretation of the findings of how rental prices vary over time and neighborhoods in San Francisco.

5.  **Napoleon's march.** The instructions for this exercise are simple: recreate the Napoleon's march plot by Charles John Minard in ggplot2. The data is provided as a list, saved as `napoleon.rds`. Read it in using `read_rds()`. This object has three elements: `cities`, `temperatures`, and `troops`. Each of these is a data frame, and the three of them combined contain all of the data you need to recreate the visualization. Your goal isn't to create an exact replica of the original plot, but to get as close to it as you can using code you understand and can describe articulately in your response. I'll be the first to say that if you google "Napoleon's march in ggplot2", you'll find a bunch of blog posts, tutorials, etc. that walk you through how to recreate this visualization with ggplot2. So you might be thinking, "why am I being asked to copy something off the internet for my homework?" Well, this is an exercise in (1) working with web resources and citing them properly, (2) understanding someone else's ggplot2 code and reproducing their work, (3) describing what that code does in your own words, and finally (4) putting some final touches to make the final product your own. Some more guidelines below:

    -   You should make sure your response properly cites all of the resources you use. I'm defining "use" to include "browse, read, get inspired by, or directly borrow snippets of code from". You don't need to worry about formal citations, it's okay to make a list with links to your resources and provide a brief summary of how you used each one.
    -   For this exercise, you're asked to describe what your code does (instead of interpreting the visualization, since we already did that in class). If you write the code, it should be straightforward for you to describe it. If you borrow any code from outside resources, you need to understand what that code does, and describe it, ***in your own words***. (This is important, you're allowed to use found code, but you are not allowed to copy someone's blog post or tutorial as your description of their code.)
    -   Finally, you should personalize the visualization with your own touch. You can do this in a myriad of ways, e.g., change colors, annotations, labels, etc. This change should be made to make the plot more like the original in some way. You need to explicitly call out what change you made and why you made it.
